# BreweryCli

Welcome! This Brewery CLI program allows you to search breweries in the United States using a zip code, the name of a city, or the name of a state. Additionally, you can look up information such as the address and phone number for any breweries you find. I hope you enjoy using it and find it helpful!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'brewery_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install brewery_cli

## Usage

Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. To run the program, run `bin/brewery_cli` and follow the prompts. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
